# üì± Flutter App

A Flutter application built using **FVM-managed Flutter version 3.32.0**, following  **clean folder
architecture** for scalability and maintainability.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### üîß Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (Managed via FVM)
- [FVM (Flutter Version Manager)](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation/)
- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
- Android Studio or VS Code (with Flutter and Dart plugins)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)

---

### Install FVM

```bash
brew tap leoafarias/fvm
brew install fvm
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run with FVM

1. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
fvm install
fvm flutter pub get
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ***Run for model generations***

```bash
fvm flutter pub run build_runner build -d
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ***Run the project***

```bash
fvm flutter run --dart-define-from-file=config.dev.json
```

### Project Architecture

Used Clean Architecture in this project where each feature seperated and layered from api call to
user render.

- Data Layer: contains api call data sources, models and repository implementation
- Domain Layer: contains abstract repository and entity class that will contain data to show in UI
  and also use case which is responsible for application logic
- Presentation Layer: this layer contains cubit state management and root pages and it's seperated
  widgets

### State management (BLoC/Cubit):

Used BLoC/Cubit as a state management. Cubit is a lightweight version of BLoC (Business Logic
Component) from the flutter_bloc package. It's part of the same library but offers a simpler way to
manage state.

- Managing and emitting UI states (e.g., loading, success, error)

- Handling business logic like API calls or local DB operations

- Updating the UI reactively via state changes
